<h5>
    React strict mode is a safe mode for optimization... React.strict
</h5>
<h3>Components best praactices</h3>
<p>component name should be  capatalize and the function name should be capatalize

<p>
    in some libraries like vite/parcel etc some extra rules like component name with jsx must be included

<h2>why we call react a single page</h2>
<p> it is because we are rendering only one root page no creating another html elemnts for that</p>
<p>In the react we have two dependencies which are main React and React.dom </p>
<p>React-dom creaetes a virtual dom called React.dom and compare it with the real dom and aafter comparing it change the specific element in the actual dom 
    React-dom has its own component trees like in js-dom has its own element tree..
