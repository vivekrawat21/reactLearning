What createRoot method do : it create dom like structure 
in dom after a reload the whole dom structure is repainted and that's why we see a loading thing in the web page
but in the virtual dom we can trace the tree and update the dom  only for the some elements which we needed.
React fiber Archietecture:
React Fiber is an ogoing reimplementation of React's core algorithm / or virtual dom
Key features of fibre:
ability to pause ,abort, or reuse works aas new update,and new concurrent primitives
what is reconciliation : the algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which part to be changed. Or simply compare dom with virtual dom or fiber
recoccilaition is the algorithm behing wha  is popularly understood as virtualdom..
fiber is a ground-up rewrite of the reconciler, the high level algorithm

why we intorduce key when we map :
Diffin of lists is perfomed using keys. Keys should be stable predictable and unique.
